# Job Listings Angular App

This repo is from a course on building multiple pages in Angular.  Here I used
an existing copy of the MeanJS stack as a boilerplate install for this App. From
there I worked to better customize it so that I could build our Angular frontend
for job listings.

This repo had me working on a lot of different things.  Setting up and working
with the Node.JS and MongoDB side of things to create our API backend.  Then
using that with Angular to create a fully functional CRUD website that allows
us to create job postings and browse other job postings.

There was a lot of new stuff in this that was a little bit overwhelming, but I
plan on going back in and looking into a lot of the MEAN stack more closely to
make sure I understand how to work with it.
